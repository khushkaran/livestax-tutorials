Trigger Data
===

In this tutorial we will build upon the Pet Finder app and allow it to communicate
to another app, the Pet Finder History. As itâ€™s name suggests, it will contain a
list of pet names that have been recently searched for.

1. Create a LiveStax App
---

As we did in the previous app, we will start off by creating a skeleton LiveStax
app with the LiveStax JavaScript and the LiveStax Theme from the CDN.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <link href="http://dz44vc6ose3il.cloudfront.net/theme.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">

```
